# 🎬 Movie React App

🔗 **Live Site:** [https://joffreyxd.github.io/Movie-react-app/](https://joffreyxd.github.io/)

This is a simple and clean **Movie Search App** built with **React + Vite**. It was created as part of my learning journey in frontend development, specifically to practice:

- 🔄 **Fetching data from an API**
- 🧠 **Using React Hooks** like `useState` and `useEffect`
- 🔗 **Implementing routing** with `react-router-dom`
- ⭐ **Adding favorites functionality**

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Search Movies** using an external API
- 📄 **View movie details** like title and release year
- ⭐ **Add movies to Favorites**
- 🌐 **Client-side routing** with `Routes` and `Link`
- ⚙️ Built with **React + Vite** for fast performance

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- `useState` for managing movie data and favorites
- `useEffect` for fetching data when the component loads or updates
- `react-router-dom` to handle navigation between pages
- Building reusable components and managing app structure
- Deploying with **GitHub Pages**

---
